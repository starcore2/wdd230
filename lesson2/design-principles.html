        the web site address as a external hyperlink,
        a mobile view screenshot* of an organization's web page that, in your opinion, illustrates that principle, and
        a brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on that page.
        Use CSS media queries to create three responsive views (small, medium, and large) of the page to change the number of columns in the main element to one column, two columns, and three columns, respectively.
        Use CSS Grid layout for the main area of the page to control the columns.

            There is a massive section of white space to the left on my screen that compresses the text area into a more readable format. It's annoying to try to read a paragraph with horrible spacing.

            The color design is clean for the site as a whole. I like the colors and how the site flows. I read a lot of stuff from there and if I hated the site design I would probably not bother coming back.

            Steam execells in having the site give context clues such as the banners being movable by havinga minor animation play when it switches what it shows. It's a compact and effective site. A lesser site would have a bunch of stuff see all at once. Steam instead breaks the games into parts to show you instead. No wall of games for the homepage. Just some stuff you may be intrested in.
